###Technologies:
HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Ajax

###How does it work?
The user choose the category, then he can buy what he want and select how many he wants from each selected item, after that he can added to the list of orders.
Then he can change the category and buy another items and it would be adde to the same order list by using Ajax to change the main content of the page without changing the order list and jQuery to add these selected items to the list.
Finally the final cost will be aclculated and send to PayPal website to allow the user pay online.
